# AI4FoodSecurity Challenge - ESA's AI4EO Initiative

Third place solution for AI4FoodSecurity Challenge organized by ESA, Planet, TUM, DLR, and Radiant Earth. 

The goal of this challenge was to classify crop types based on time series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Planet Fusion Monitoring Data. The datasets provided presented two main challenges to the community: exploit the temporal dimension for improved crop classification and ensure that models can handle a domain shift to a different year.
